   - Locate the log file where the error "APPIC008E failed to get application user session" is being recorded.

2. **Identify Monitoring Tools:**
   - Determine the monitoring tools or platforms you have in place, such as New Relic, that can provide alerting capabilities.

3. **Create a Query or Rule:**
   - If using a monitoring tool like New Relic, create a query or rule to filter logs for the specified error message.

4. **Set Up an Alert Policy:**
   - Create a new alert policy within your monitoring tool.
   - Add a condition based on the query or rule created in step 3 to trigger the alert when the error occurs.

5. **Define Alert Thresholds:**
   - Define the threshold for triggering the alert, such as the number of occurrences of the error within a specific time frame.

6. **Configure Notification Channels:**
   - Set up a notification channel within your monitoring tool to send alerts.
   - Configure the notification channel to send alerts to the Web Console log file.

7. **Test and Validate:**
   - Test the alert configuration to ensure that it triggers correctly when the error "APPIC008E failed to get application user session" occurs.
