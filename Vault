#001 Steps for Adding Users to "Vault Admins" Group in PrivateArk Client
## Introduction:
Adding users to the "Vault Admins" group in the PrivateArk Client grants them administrative privileges within the CyberArk Vault. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for adding users to the "Vault Admins" group.

## Steps:

1. **Log-in to PrivateArk Client:**
   - Launch the PrivateArk Client application.

2. **Navigate to Users and Groups:**
   - Go to `Tools` > `Administrative Tools` > `Users and Groups`.

3. **Locate "Vault Admins" Group:**
   - Under the 'System' section, locate the "Vault Admins" group. This group contains users with administrative privileges.

4. **Select "Update" Option:**
   - Click on the "Update" button associated with the "Vault Admins" group.

5. **Add Users:**
   - In the dialog box that appears, add the network IDs of the users you want to add to the "Vault Admins" group.

6. **Save Changes:**
   - After adding users, save the changes.

7. **Verify Users Addition:**

- Exercise caution when granting administrative privileges to users, as they will have access to sensitive vault data and configurations.



#002 How to Trigger a Full Replication on DR Vault
## Introduction
In some cases, it may be necessary to trigger a full replication on the Disaster Recovery (DR) Vault server to resolve issues with replication. This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to perform a full replication on the DR Vault.

## Step-by-step instructions

### 1. Stop PrivateArk Server Service:
   - On the DR Vault machine, ensure that the PrivateArk Server service is stopped.

### 2. Edit PADR.ini File:
   - Navigate to the DR installation folder (usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\PrivateArk\PADR`).
   - Open the `PADR.ini` file.

### 3. Modify PADR.ini:
   - Within the `PADR.ini` file, do the following:
     i. Set the following parameter:
        ```
        Failovermode=no
        ```
     ii. Delete the following parameters:
        ```
        NextBinaryLogNumberToStartAt
        LastDataReplicationTimestamp
        ```
     iii. Save the file.

### 4. Restart CyberArk Vault Disaster Recovery Service:
   - Restart the CyberArk Vault Disaster Recovery service.

### 5. Verify Replication:
   - Check the `PADR.log` file to ensure that a full replication was carried out successfully.

## Additional Notes:
- Triggering a full replication on the DR Vault may resolve issues with replication and ensure data consistency between the primary and DR Vaults.
