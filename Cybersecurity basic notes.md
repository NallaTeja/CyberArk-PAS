### Cybersecurity Frameworks

1. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: 
   - Guidelines for identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyberattacks.

2. **ISO 27001/27002**: 
   - International standards for information security management systems (ISMS).

3. **SOC 2**: 
   - Criteria for assessing security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy for cloud service providers.

4. **HIPAA**: 
   - Standards for protecting health information.

5. **GDPR**: 
   - European Union's regulation focusing on data privacy and protection.

6. **FISMA**: 
   - Security requirements for federal agencies.

7. **NERC-CIP**: 
   - Cybersecurity standards for electric reliability and critical infrastructure.

8. **CIS Controls**: 
   - Actionable best practices to enhance security posture.

9. **COBIT**: 
   - Framework for business-IT alignment and governance.

10. **HITRUST CSF**: 
    - Tailored cybersecurity framework for the healthcare industry.

11. **NY DFS**: 
    - New York's financial security regulation.

### Common Cyber Attacks

1. **DDoS Attacks**: 
   - Overwhelm a system with traffic to disrupt service.

2. **Malware Attacks**: 
   - Includes ransomware, trojans, and spyware that damage or steal data.

3. **Phishing Attacks**: 
   - Deceptive emails or messages tricking users into revealing sensitive information.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: 
   - Intercepts communication between two parties to eavesdrop or alter the data.

5. **SQL Injection Attacks**: 
   - Exploits database vulnerabilities to execute malicious SQL commands.

6. **Zero-Day Exploits**: 
   - Exploits unknown software vulnerabilities before they are patched.

7. **Password Attacks**: 
   - Attempts to guess or crack passwords to gain unauthorized access, often using brute force methods.

8. **Drive-by Download Attacks**: 
   - Installs malware on a user's device through compromised websites without their knowledge.

9. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks**: 
   - Injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

10. **Rootkits**: 
    - Stealthy software that hides its presence and other malware on a system.

11. **DNS Tunneling and Spoofing**: 
    - Manipulates DNS queries to bypass security measures or exfiltrate data.

12. **Internet of Things (IoT) Attacks**: 
    - Targets vulnerabilities in connected devices to gain access or cause disruption.

13. **Session Hijacking**: 
    - Takes over a user's session to impersonate them and gain unauthorized access.

14. **URL Manipulation**: 
    - Alters URLs to redirect users to malicious sites or steal information.

### OWASP

- **OWASP ASVS**: 
  - A set of security requirements for designing, developing, and testing modern web applications and services.

### OSI Model Layers

1. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**: 
   - Physical connection and transmission of raw bit streams (e.g., hubs, repeaters, modems, cables).

2. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**: 
   - Node-to-node data transfer and error correction (e.g., switches, bridges).

3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: 
   - Device addressing and packet forwarding (e.g., IP, routers).

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: 
   - End-to-end data transfer and error recovery (e.g., TCP, UDP).

5. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**: 
   - Connection management between applications.

6. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**: 
   - Data translation and encryption.

7. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**: 
   - Network services for applications (e.g., HTTP, SMTP, FTP).

### Cyber Kill Chain

1. **Reconnaissance**: 
   - Gathering information about the target.

2. **Weaponization**: 
   - Creating tailored malware.

3. **Delivery**: 
   - Sending malware to the target.

4. **Exploitation**: 
   - Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access.

5. **Installation**: 
   - Establishing a foothold on the system.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**: 
   - Remote control of the compromised system.

7. **Actions on Objectives**: 
   - Achieving the attacker's goals (e.g., data theft).
---

8. **Exfiltration**: 
   - Stealing and sending data to the attacker.

9. **Monetization**: 
   - Profiting from stolen data (e.g., selling on the dark web).
